Server-Client Keylogger that logs and saves pressed keys into a file
then send the data to the server

after creating the software it felt too simple and basic.
At the same time i learned how to make a server-client.
So, I thought of applying that to the project.

The idea is that the keylogger works hidden in the background
and the server wait for the client to connect and send the log file.
In this situation the attacker is the server and the victim is the client.

Video explanations:
1. At the start of the video, I show that the log file is empty, and that the keylogger is not running.
2. Then I ran the keylogger that can only be seen in the task manager.
3. Then I opened the text file and wrote “Text ” and [ctrl] s to save.
4. Showed that the log file is updated then opened the server-client.
5. The client connected to the server and sent the log-file content.
